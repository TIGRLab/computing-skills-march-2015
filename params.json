{"name":"Computing-skills-march-2015","tagline":"A series of workshops on basic computing skills for CAMH researchers","body":"These workshops will focus on some basic computing skills you need\r\nfor getting study data organized, using the CAMH compute cluster (SCC), and\r\ngenerally doing computing-oriented scientific work.\r\n\r\nYou should attend if you are doing any sort of scientific computing work. If you have questions, send me email: jon.pipitone@camh.ca\r\n\r\n## Workshop Schedule\r\n\r\n### Gentle Introduction to Linux\r\n*Date:* Tuesday, March 3, 2015, 12:00 pm to 2:00 pm (next week!)\r\n*Location:* Room 163, 1st Floor, 250 College St.\r\n*Register:* https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/gentle-introduction-to-linux-tickets-15897827831\r\n*Prerequisites:* none\r\n*Why you should attend:* Computers aren't scary (yet) and knowing how to use them will make doing science better/easier/quicker\r\n*You'll learn:* What is Linux? What is a terminal/shell? What is the SCC? Managing (making, moving, editing) files and folders. Remote access (SSH/FTP). Where to find help online/etc.\r\n\r\n### Introduction to the Linux Shell / Automating repetitive tasks\r\n*Date:* Tuesday, March 10, 2015 10:00 am to 12:00 pm\r\n*Location:* Room 163, 1st Floor, 250 College St.\r\n*Register:* https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/introduction-to-the-linux-shell-automating-repetitive-tasks-tickets-15897978281\r\n*Prerequisites:* Minimal familiarity with Linux (e.g. cd, ls, mv, cp)\r\n*Why you should attend:* These are the basics. Also, doing work on lots of data by hand is boring and error prone.\r\n*What you'll learn:* Running commands on many files (globbing, looping, if statements), reading and writing to files, sorting/filtering data in files\r\n\r\n### Shell scripting and automation / Using a compute cluster\r\n*Date:* Tuesday, March 17, 2015 10:00 am to 12:00 pm\r\n*Location:* Room 163, 1st Floor, 250 College St.\r\n*Register:* https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/shell-scripting-and-automation-using-a-compute-cluster-tickets-15897993326\r\n*Prerequisites:* Familiarity with using the shell interactively\r\n*Why you should attend:* We have access to lots of computing power, so learn how to use it effectively.\r\n*What you'll learn:* Writing scripts, chaining tools together (pipes, redirection), running commands in parallel, running commands in parallel on the SCC/SciNet\r\n\r\n### Introduction to R (an free alternative to SAS/SPSS)\r\n*Date:* Tuesday, March 24, 2015 10:00 am to 12:00 pm\r\n*Location:* Room 163, 1st Floor, 250 College St.\r\n*Register:* https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/introduction-to-r-tickets-15898000347\r\n*Prerequisites:* programming/scripting experience in any other language (e.g. you've used a for loop before, used functions/libraries)\r\n*Why you should attend:* R is a featureful and sometimes magical language for doing statistical analysis. And it's free. This workshop won't cover much about the stats you can do with R, but will help you get your data in order.\r\n*What you'll learn:* writing R scripts (using the Rstudio IDE), using/installing packages, reading/sorting/merging/filtering tabular data (e.g. CSV files), some basic statistics (incl. linear regression), visualising data/models\r\n\r\n### Introduction to Python\r\n*Date:* Tuesday, March 31, 2015 10:00 am to 12:00 pm\r\n*Location:* Room 163, 1st Floor, 250 College St.\r\n*Register:* https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/introduction-to-python-tickets-15898015392\r\n*Prerequisites:* programming experience in any other language\r\n*Why you should attend:* Python is a mainstay in scientific computing. It has a plethora of libraries you can use and build on. Can be a replacement for MATLAB, and shell scripting, etc..\r\n*What you'll learn:* writing Python scripts (using the Pycharm IDE), using/installing packages, reading/writing files, working with lists and dictionaries of data, numpy/scipy basics","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
